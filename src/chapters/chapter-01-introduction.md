# Introduction

Welcome to your ebook! This is a sample chapter to get you started.

## Getting Started

This template provides a structured approach to creating professional ebooks. You can write your content in Markdown, which offers several advantages:

- **Simple syntax** that's easy to learn and read
- **Version control friendly** - track changes easily with Git
- **Portable format** - convert to multiple output formats
- **Focus on content** - no distractions from complex formatting

## What's Next

Start by editing this file and adding your own content. Create new chapters by following the naming convention:

- `chapter-02-your-title.md`
- `chapter-03-another-title.md`

Remember to update the metadata in `src/metadata/book.yaml` with your book's information.

Happy writing!
